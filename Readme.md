project_speller

This project aims to find misspelled words in a text and present it in a resulting text file „student.txt“. It has been the final project after 6 weeks of c programming during the course CS50 of Havard University. All the functions that I wrote in C you’ll find in the file „dictionary.c“.  This file will be called by „speller.c“ eventually.
